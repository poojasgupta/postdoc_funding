# Postdoctoral funding opportunities

This non-exhaustive list of postdoctoral funding opportunities was inspired by the list compiled by [Marissa Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett) and made available on her [website](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html#Postdoc). 

I have decided to import it to GitHub in order to facilitate its modification and updating by the community. Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests in order to grow the list. For each item, try to add additional useful information such as eligibility, location, etc., between brackets after the link.
